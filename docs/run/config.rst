===================================================
Configuration
===================================================

| The configuration for node setting is written in *YAML*.

---------------------------------------------------
address
---------------------------------------------------

| Address of local node(alias for url address)

.. code-block:: none

    address: n0sas

---------------------------------------------------
genesis-operations
---------------------------------------------------

| ``genesis-operation`` is a setting for the genesis operation that is executed when the network is initialized.
| ``genesis-operation`` contains the contents of the block that is initially created.

| In the currency model, information on the main currency and genesis account must be set.

| It registers the information about,

* Keys of the *genesis account* (key, weight, threshold)
* Initial balance
* Currency ID
* Fee policy of the currency to be created

| For example,

.. code-block:: none

    genesis-operations:
        - account-keys:
            keys:
                - publickey: rcrd3KA2wWNhKdAP8rHRzfRmgp91oR9mqopckyXRmCvGmpu
                  weight: 100
            threshold: 100
        currencies:
            - balance: "99999999999999999999"
              currency: MCC
              new-account-min-balance: "33"
        type: genesis-currencies

---------------------------------------------------
network
---------------------------------------------------

| Specify the *domain address* or *IP address* of the node used in the network.
| Address to receive messages from node or client, using *quic* communication protocol.
| *Self-signed certificates* can be used to set up test node. You can use it for only test and development nodes where security is not a big concern.

.. code-block:: shell
    
    $ openssl genrsa -out mitum.key 4096

    $ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key mitum.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out mitum.crt
    
| For example,

.. code-block:: none

    network:
        bind: https://0.0.0.0:54321
        url: https://127.0.0.1:54321
        cert-key: mitum.key
        cert: mitum.crt

rate-limit
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| Basically, API interface of internet service allows to connect from client without restriction.
| However, too many requests to service does harm to the performance of service
| To maintain the service to be stable, ``rate limit`` can be applied to the API service.

| See `Rate limiting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting>`_.

| Mitum supports *quic* based API service for communication within nodes, even none-suffrages.
| Mitum Currency additionally supports *http2* based API service, called digest.

| ``rate-limit`` applied to these API services.

.. code-block:: none

    network:
        bind: https://0.0.0.0:54321
        url: https://127.0.0.1:54321

        rate-limit:
            cache: "memory:?prefix=showme"
            preset:
                bad-nodes:
                    new-seal: 3/2m
                    blockdata: 4/m
            3.3.3.3:
                preset: bad-nodes
            4.4.4.4/24:
                preset: bad-nodes
                blockdata: 5/m
            127.0.0.1/24:
                preset: suffrage

* ``cache``: cache for requests. At this time, supports “memory:” and “redis://<redis server>”

  * **memory**: memory cache
  * **redis://<redis server>**: cached in redis server

* ``preset``: pre defined rate limit settings.

    * For Mitum, ``suffrage`` and ``world`` presets are already defined. See `launch/config/ratelimit.go <https://github.com/spikeekips/mitum/blob/master/launch/config/ratelimit.go>`_ in the source code.
    * You can make your own rate limit setting like bad-nodes.

* Rules:

    * **Rate-limit Settings** for a specific IP
    * Rules consist of *IP address* (or IP address range), ``preset`` and detailed ``rate-limit`` settings.
    * The IP address can be a single value or a range of IP addresses expressed in *CIDR* notation.
      * example : 3.3.3.3, 4.4.4.4/24, 127.0.0.1/24
    * Rate limit can be set through ``preset`` and additional ``limits``.
    * ``preset`` can be pre-defined preset like ``suffrage``, ``world`` or user-defined preset like ``bad-nodes``.
    * Additional limit such as ``blockdata: 5/m`` can be added to the ``preset``.
    * Rules will be checked by the defined order. The upper rule will be checked first.

* Detailed limit:

    * The name of the API interface for Mitum, such as new-seal, used to set the limit can be found in RateLimitHandleMap (launch/config/ratelimit.go).
    * The name of the API interface for Mitum-currency can be found in RateLimitHandlerMap (digest/handler.go).
    * new-seal: 3/2m means new-seal interface allows 3 requests per 2 minutes to the specified IP or IP range.
    * See the manner of time duration.

* Without any rules, by default no rate limit.

| A limit value less than zero means unlimited.

| For example,

.. code-block:: none

    4.4.4.4/24:
    preset: bad-nodes
    blockdata: -1/m

| The zero limit value means that the request is blocked.

| For example,

.. code-block:: none

    4.4.4.4/24:
        preset: bad-nodes
        blockdata: 0/m

---------------------------------------------------
network-id
---------------------------------------------------

| ``network id`` acts like an identifier that **identifies a network**.
| All nodes on the same network have the same ``network id`` value.

| For example,

.. code-block:: none

    network-id: mitum

---------------------------------------------------
keypair
---------------------------------------------------

| Enter the **node's private key**.

| For example,

.. code-block:: none

    privatekey: Kxt22aSeFzJiDQagrvfXPWbEbrTSPsRxbYm9BhNbNJTsrbPbFnPAmpr

| See `Key Command <https://protocon-general-doc.readthedocs.io/en/develop/docs/cli/key.html>`_ to learn how to create a key pair.

---------------------------------------------------
storage
---------------------------------------------------

| Specify the *file system path* and *mongodb database address* of blockchain data storage.
| If blockdata setting is missing, *blockdata > path* is set to a folder called *blockdata* in the current path by default.

| For example, 

.. code-block:: none

    storage:
    blockdata:
        path: ./mc-blockfs
    database:
        uri: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mc

| ``port number`` should be same with that when running docker.

---------------------------------------------------
suffrage
---------------------------------------------------

nodes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| Set addresses for suffrage nodes participating in consensus.

| The alias name of the local node is ``n0sas``.
| If ``n0``, ``n1``, ``n2``, ``n3`` nodes are included in the suffrage nodes, it can be set as follows.

.. code-block:: none

    suffrage:
        nodes:
            - n0sas
            - n1sas
            - n2sas
            - n3sas

| If the ``n0`` node, which is a local node, is not included in the suffrage nodes, the local node becomes a *None-suffrage* node and serves only as a *syncing node*.

* The *Syncing node* does not participate in consensus and only syncs the generated block data.
* The *None-suffrage* node handles only the seal containing the operation.
* The *None-suffrage* node does not process ballots and proposals related to voting between nodes.
* When the *None-suffrage* node stores the operation seal, it broadcasts the seal to the suffrage nodes.

| If the *None-suffrage* node does not add other nodes to the suffrage node, or does not configure other suffrage nodes, operation seal cannot be processed.

.. code-block:: none

    suffrage:
        nodes:
            - n1sas
            - n2sas
            - n3sas

---------------------------------------------------
sync-interval
---------------------------------------------------

| *None-suffrage* node periodically syncs block data.

| The default interval is 10 seconds.
| You can change the interval value through the ``sync-interval`` setting.

.. code-block:: none

    sync-interval: 3s

---------------------------------------------------
nodes
---------------------------------------------------

| Write the ``address`` (alias for the address), ``public key``, and ``url`` (ip address) of known nodes in the blockchain network.

* If not written, it operates as a **standalone node**.
* If the node is a suffrage node and the node discovery function is used, the ``url`` of the node is not required.
* However, if the node is not a suffrage node, the ``url``s of the suffrage nodes must be included.

| Mitum nodes use *CA signed certificate* (public certificate) by default.

* If certificate related settings are not made in *Network config*, the node uses *self-signed certificate*.
* If other Mitum nodes use self-signed certificate, ``tls-insecure: true`` should be set to all the nodes which use self-signed certificate.

.. code-block:: none

    (In case of suffrage node)

    nodes:
        - address: n1sas

        url: https://127.0.0.1:54351
        tls-insecure: true

---------------------------------------------------
digest
---------------------------------------------------

| Specify the *mongodb address* that stores the data to be provided by the *API* and the *IP address* of the API access.

.. code-block:: none

    digest:
        network:
            bind: https://localhost:54320
            url: https://localhost:54320
            cert-key: mitum.key
            cert: mitum.crt
