Blockchain Application Model
===================================================

| *Mitum* is designed to be used as a general purpose blockchain. To meet this requirement, the **policy** and **data** of Mitum can be configured and managed in a practical way.

| In simpler terms, network designers will design their network in two parts:

* Data
* Policy

| By configuring the *data* and *policy*, designers can build and launch their own model of network.

| For example, suppose that a designer wants to build a currency model in Mitum. The designer can define several currencies and relative data and add additional policy.

| Data types:

* account
* balance

| Policy:

* total amount
* minimum amount of new balance
* multisig
* inflation
* etc...
