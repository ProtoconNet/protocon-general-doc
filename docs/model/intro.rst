Blockchain Application Model
===================================================

| *Mitum* is designed for general purpose blockchain. To fill this requirement, **policy** and **data** of Mitum can be configurable and manageable by practical way.

| To make a long story short, network designers will design their network in 2 parts:

* Data
* Policy

| By designing *data* and *policy*, designers can build and launch their own model of network.

| For example, suppose that a designer want to build currency model in Mitum. He/She can define several currencies and relative data and add additional policy.

| Data types:

* account
* balance

| Policy:

* total amount
* minimum amount of new balance
* multisig
* inflation
* etc...
